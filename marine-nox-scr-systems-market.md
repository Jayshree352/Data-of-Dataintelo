## Market Dynamics

The introduction of International Maritime Organization (IMO) Tier III emission standards has compelled shipbuilders and fleet operators to install NOx-reducing technologies. SCR systems use ammonia or urea-based reagents to convert NOx emissions into harmless nitrogen and water, enabling vessels to meet strict environmental norms.

Growing environmental awareness, coupled with increasing global shipping activities, is propelling the market forward. Additionally, rising investments in retrofitting existing ships with SCR systems and the expansion of new shipbuilding projects are key factors supporting market growth.
